redis:(venv not required for that terminal)
    linux- redis server installation cmd - `sudo apt install -y redis-server` (prefered)
    win - use the exe installer from the redis website

    py lib - pip install redis, (if you are using venv, install it in venv, else its fine)

    {optional}
    gui for redis-server- install it in win from the redis website, name is redis-insight (if im using wsl, still would install redis-insight in win)
        as insight would communicate with redis-server using localhost
